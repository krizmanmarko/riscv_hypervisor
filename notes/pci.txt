dtb entry (read https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Usage#PCI_Address_Translation)

#address-cells = <0x03>;
#size-cells = <0x01>;
pci.ranges = <	0x1000000 0x00 0x00		0x00 0x3000000		0x00 0x10000
		0x2000000 0x00 0x40000000	0x00 0x40000000		0x00 0x40000000
		0x3000000 0x04 0x00		0x04 0x00		0x04 0x00>;

first three entries are address cells. addr.high are flags, addr.mid << 32 | addr.low is address
second 2 entries represent address in CPU AS where this area is mapped.
last 2 entries represent size of this area

phys.hi cell: npt000ss bbbbbbbb dddddfff rrrrrrrr
phys.mid cell: hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh
phys.low cell: llllllll llllllll llllllll llllllll

n: relocatable region flag (doesn't play a role here)
p: prefetchable (cacheable) region flag
t: aliased address flag (doesn't play a role here)
ss: space code
	00: configuration space
	01: I/O space
	10: 32 bit memory space
	11: 64 bit memory space
bbbbbbbb: The PCI bus number
ddddd: The device number, typically associated with IDSEL signal connections.
fff: The function number. Used for multifunction PCI devices.
rrrrrrrr: Register number; used for configuration cycles.
