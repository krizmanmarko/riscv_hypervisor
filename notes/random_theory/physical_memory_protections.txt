Physical Memory Attributes
==========================

PMAs are inherent properties of the underlying hardware and rarely change
during system operation.

1. Main memory
Always supports read/write of any access width, optionally if fetching
is supported.

2. I/O memory
I/O regions can specify which combinations of read, write, or execute
accesses to which data widths are supported.

3. vacant memory (not used memory)


Physical Memory Protection
==========================

rwx bits for physical memory accesses (from S, U-mode or via translation)

memory access control. By default S, U modes have no permissions. M has
full permissions. Very platform dependent
