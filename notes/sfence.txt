sfence.vma rd, rs1, rs2
	- asid (rs2)
	- vaddr (rs1)
	- 0 (rd)

if rs1 == x0 and rs2 == x0:
	full tlb flush (even global mappings)

if rs1 == x0 and rs2 != x0:
	only asid (from rs2) is flushed

if rs1 != x0 and rs2 == x0:
	flush only one page (for all address spaces)

if rs1 != x0 and rs2 != x0:
	flush only one page (for only one address space)

if rs1 is invalid:
	sfence.vma == nop

sfence.vma is used to flush any local hardware caches related to address
translation

global sfence.vma is done via IPIs

In general, you need to SFENCE after you've recycled an ASID.

https://blog.stephenmarz.com/2021/02/01/wrong-about-sfence/
sfence.vma should be invoked if:

1. When software recycles an ASID
	- write satp
	- sfence.vma (rs1=zero, rs2=recycled ASID)

2. if software only uses single ASID
	- write satp
	- sfence.vma

3. if leaf gets more permissions than it had you can call sfence.vma in
   exception handler
