This document shows pretty some obscure situations where assumebd
behaviour did not match reality. It also provides examples on how
this bit me in the ass.


===========================
Is char signed or unsigned?
===========================

Depends on the compiler...
my riscv64 gnu toolchain's default char is unsigned
my x86_64 linux gnu toolchain's default char is signed
(note: int is always signed)

typedef char int8;	<- is actually uint8


=====================================
Providing a symbol from linker script
=====================================

* and [] do not work the same way.
Following examples show correct usage of symbols defined in linker script:

extern type symbol_name_start;
extern type symbol_name_end;
size_t size = &symbol_name_end - &symbol_name_start;

extern type symbol_name_start[];
extern type symbol_name_end[];
size_t size = symbol_name_end - symbol_name_start;

extern type *symbol_name_start;
extern type *symbol_name_end;
size_t size = &symbol_name_end - &symbol_name_start;
