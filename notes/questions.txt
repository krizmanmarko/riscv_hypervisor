Why are virtual addresses of different size to physical addresses


--- Solved ---

When H extension is enabled, do we control 3 seperate registers for status
(vsstatus, hstatus, sstatus) or are sstatus and hstatus equal?
  sstatus is just a masked mstatus, whereas hstatus and vsstatus are completely
  seperate registers (so we only have mstatus, hstatus and vsstatus registers)

where is V bit? (virtualization bit)
  Check out hypervisor MSTATUS_SPV (supervisor previous virtualization mode)
  works the same way as MSTATUS_MPP (machine previous privilege mode)

Software interrupt vs exception_ECALL_FROM_U_MODE
  software interrupt is IPI (inter-hart interrupt)
  ecall from X-mode happens when ecall instruction is executed on current hart

Why can medeleg have EXC_ECALL_FROM_M bit set?
This would imply that supervisor software handles M-mode ecalls
  In qemu-virt setting medeleg.EXC_ECALL_FROM_M does not delegate M-mode ecalls
  to supervisor mode (still handled in mtrapvec)
  So it has no effect on the execution (probably should be read-only 0)
