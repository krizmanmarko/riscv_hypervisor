CPU
===

figure out how to provide VM information and run baremetal app

vcpu (context switching memory reservation)
vm entry, vm exit

[+] timer interrupt
ipi?
external interrupt / plic

[+] check which variables need volatile (only lock->locked)
[+] check where a noirq_lock can be used (but I completely removed irq_lock)

struct lock does not need to be struct really,
structs_in_asm.h does not need to export LOCK_stuff <- legacy code
